\title{Select simple and stratified random samples from a sampling frame.}
\usage{
select_sample_prop(
  sampling_frame,
  stratum = stratum,
  frac,
  seed = NA,
  replace = FALSE,
  min_stratum = 0
)

select_sample_str(
  sampling_frame,
  allocation,
  sample_size,
  stratum,
  is_frac = FALSE,
  seed = NA,
  replace = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampling_frame}{\code{tibble} with the sampling frame it must contain a
column with the stratum.}

\item{stratum}{unquoted column with strata in the allocation and
sampling_frame \code{tibble}'s (the columns must have the same name in the
two \code{tibble}'s). If one wants to select a SRS the stratum
parameter is not used.}

\item{frac}{when sampling with equal probability across strata, frac is a
numeric value indicating the fraction of the data to select.}

\item{seed}{integer value used to set the state of the random number generator.}

\item{replace}{logical value indicating whether the sample should be selected
with replacement.}

\item{min_stratum}{minimum sample size within strata, if greater than zero, could lead ti
non-proportional allocation.}

\item{allocation}{\code{tibble} with a column defining the strata and a
column with sample size allocations for each stratum (one line per stratum).}

\item{sample_size}{unquoted column with sample sizes in the allocation
data.frame}

\item{is_frac}{logical value indicating whether the allocation data.frame contains
proportions to be sampled within each stratum (TRUE) or sample sizes.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with the selected sample, it will have the same
columns as the original sampling frame plus a column indicating the sample
size in the stratum of each selected observation.
}
\description{
Select Simple Random Samples and Stratified Random Samples,
\code{select_sample_prop} can be used when sampling with equal probability
across strata or when selecting a simple random sample.
